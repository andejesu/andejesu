## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Andrew, and I'm literally just getting started with github. 

This is where I am going to attempt to document a summary of the projects I've been working on. 

For now I am utilizing YouTube/Udemy/Coursera to learn all about many fun things, so that I can develop and break into a more IT/Tech professional role. 

Specifically, those things include:

OPNSense (Firewall, Networking, Segmentation)

Proxmox (virtualization, Containerization)

Docker (Containerization)

Wazuh (SIEM, Threat Hunting)

Splunk (Analysis, Virtualization, SIEM)

...And really just doing everything I can to absorb as much information to make my homelab as Neat as possible. That includes:

Game Hosting

Discord Bots

Pen/Defensive Testing

Security principles & best practices

Networking

So hopefully in learning this I become better at it. Because afterall, isn't that what we're here for?
